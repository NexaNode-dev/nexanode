# Frontend Feature Libraries

Frontend feature libraries encapsulate the business logic of specific features within an application. These libraries are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application or even across different projects. They allow for a clean separation of concerns by abstracting feature-specific logic away from UI components. Here, we will discuss creating frontend feature libraries in both Angular and React.

## Angular

In Angular, a feature library is typically a module that encapsulates all the components, services, and other Angular entities related to a specific feature.

### Feature Module Implementation

#### ArticleFeatureModule Example

```typescript
// src/app/article-feature/article-list/article-list.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { ArticleService } from "../article.service";
import { Article } from "../article.model";

@Component({
  selector: "app-article-list",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: "./article-list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./article-list.component.css"],
})
export class ArticleListComponent implements OnInit {
  articles: Article[];

  constructor(private articleService: ArticleService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getArticles();
  }

  getArticles(): void {
    this.articleService.getArticles().subscribe((articles) => (this.articles = articles));
  }
}
```

This module bundles all the components and services related to the article feature, making it easy to import this entire feature into other parts of the application.

## React

In React, a feature library is not defined by the framework itself but can be conceptualized as a collection of components, hooks, and any other utilities that are related to a specific feature.

### Feature Library Implementation

#### Article Feature Example

```javascript
// src/features/article/ArticleList.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useArticles } from "./useArticles"; // Assuming useArticles is a custom hook for fetching articles

const ArticleList = () => {
  const { data: articles, loading, error } = useArticles();

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error loading articles!</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      {articles.map((article) => (
        <div key={article.id}>
          <h2>{article.title}</h2>
          <p>{article.summary}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ArticleList;
```

The `ArticleList` component uses the `useArticles` custom hook to fetch and display a list of articles. This is an example of how React encourages the use of hooks for abstracting and reusing logic across components, contributing to the idea of feature libraries.

Both Angular and React approaches to feature libraries help in organizing code around functional or feature areas, making it easier to maintain and scale applications. By encapsulating feature-related logic within dedicated libraries, developers can ensure that each part of the application remains focused on its specific responsibilities, leading to cleaner and more manageable codebases.
