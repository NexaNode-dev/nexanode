# Backend Applications in an NX Workspace

When developing backend applications within an NX workspace, a key principle is to maintain a lean and modular core. This approach involves structuring the application to primarily orchestrate and integrate various libraries that encapsulate the domain logic, data access, and utilities. This document provides guidelines on structuring backend applications in NX, focusing on integration and configuration, with a practical example using NestJS.

## Lean Core Philosophy

The essence of a lean core in backend applications is to minimize the application-specific code, focusing instead on integrating functionalities defined in libraries. This strategy enhances code reusability, simplifies testing, and improves maintainability across the NX workspace.

## Application Configuration

The initial setup of a backend application in an NX workspace includes essential configurations such as environment settings, middleware integration, and library imports.

### Creating a New Backend Application:

To start a new backend application, use NX Console tailored to your chosen framework. For a NestJS application, the command would be:

This generates a command that scaffolds a new application, preparing it for further configuration and integration.

### Integrating Libraries

The backend application should integrate:

1. **Domain Logic Libraries:** Import libraries containing services that implement the application's core business logic.

2. **Data Access Libraries:** Use libraries that abstract interactions with the database or external APIs, focusing on data manipulation and retrieval.

3. **Utility Libraries:** Include libraries that provide cross-cutting functionalities like logging, validation, and configuration management.

### NestJS Integration Example

Consider you have a library named `user-feature`, which includes a NestJS module with services and controllers for user management. Here's how to integrate this library into your NestJS application.

#### User Feature Module Integration:

**UserFeatureModule (within `user-feature` library):**

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserController } from './user.controller';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [UserController],
  providers: [UserService],
})
export class UserFeatureModule {}
```

**AppModule (app.module.ts):**

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserFeatureModule } from '@myorg/user-feature';

@Module({
  imports: [UserFeatureModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, `AppModule` acts as the composition root, integrating `UserFeatureModule` to leverage its user management capabilities. This demonstrates the application's role in orchestrating features provided by internal libraries.

## Best Practices

- **Focus on Integration:** Design your application as a thin layer that integrates libraries, keeping the application core minimal.
- **Emphasize Modularity:** Encourage modularity by structuring functionalities into libraries, enhancing the application's scalability and maintainability.
- **Configuration Management:** Manage configurations outside libraries to maintain their reusability and decouple them from application-specific settings.
- **Leverage NX Tools:** Utilize NX's suite of tools for efficient project management, including code generation, dependency graph analysis, and impact assessment of changes.

## Conclusion

Adopting a lean core approach for backend applications facilitates a clean separation of concerns, code reusability, and ease of maintenance. By structuring applications to integrate and configure distinct libraries for business logic, data access, and utilities, teams can build robust, scalable backend systems. The given NestJS example illustrates how to effectively integrate a feature library within an NX workspace, following these best practices.
