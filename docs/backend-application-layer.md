# Implementing the Application Layer

This document guides the structuring of the application (business logic) layer, focusing on encapsulating business rules and logic. While the examples are implemented in a specific framework, the principles are applicable universally within the context of the NexaNode project.

## Principles

The application layer serves as the core of your application's functionality, mediating between the presentation layer and data access layer. It is responsible for executing business operations, applying business rules, and ensuring the application's data flow is correctly managed.

## Service Layer

Services within the application layer handle the business logic. They interact with the data-access layer to retrieve, manipulate, and store data according to the business requirements.

### Example: Creating a UserService

The following is an example of a service that manages user data. This service utilizes a repository to interact with the database, abstracting the complexity of direct data management.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserRepository } from '@nexanode/user-data-access'; // data-access-layer

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private userRepository: UserRepository) {}

  async findAllUsers() {
    return this.userRepository.findAll();
  }

  // Additional methods to handle other business operations
}
```

In this example, UserService depends on UserRepository to fetch user data. The repository is injected into the service, illustrating the separation of concerns and the single responsibility principle.

### Connecting Services to Repositories

The integration of services with repositories is crucial for maintaining a clean architecture. Repositories abstract the data source, allowing services to focus purely on business logic.

The `UserRepository` class provides a dedicated space for data access methods, such as `findAll`, used by the `UserService` to retrieve all users.

### Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Ensure services in the application layer are focused on specific business logic or operations.
- **Loose Coupling**: Use interfaces or abstract classes for repositories to decouple the service layer from the data-access layer, facilitating easier testing and maintenance.
- **Layered Interaction**: Services should interact with the presentation layer (e.g., controllers) and the data-access layer but not directly with the database or external services.

### Conclusion

The application layer is pivotal in managing the business logic of an application, serving as a bridge between the presentation layer and the data-access layer. By adhering to the principles of clean architecture, services within this layer can remain focused on business rules, improving the application's overall structure and maintainability.
