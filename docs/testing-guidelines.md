# Testing Guidelines

This document outlines our approach to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and provides guidelines for writing and maintaining tests in our project. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and robust software.

## Principles of TDD

1. **Write Failing Tests First:** Before adding a new feature or fixing a bug, write a test that fails because the feature isn't implemented or the bug exists.
2. **Make the Test Pass:** Implement the simplest code to make the failing test pass.
3. **Refactor:** Refine the code while keeping all tests passing, improving the design and structure without altering functionality.

## Test Structure

Our tests follow the "Arrange-Act-Assert" (AAA) pattern:

- **Arrange:** Set up the test data and environment.
- **Act:** Execute the code being tested.
- **Assert:** Verify the outcome is as expected.

## Writing Effective Tests

- **Descriptive Test Names:** Test names should clearly describe what they are testing.
- **Small and Focused:** Each test should verify one aspect of the code.
- **Isolation:** Tests should not depend on external services or the execution of other tests.

## Testing Tools

- For **Angular applications**, we use Jasmine and Karma for unit and integration tests. End-to-end tests are handled by Cypress.
- For **React applications**, Jest is used for unit and integration testing, with React Testing Library to render components. Cypress is used for end-to-end testing.
- For **NestJS backend applications**, Jest is used for unit and integration tests.

## Continuous Integration

All tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that tests are automatically run on every commit. This helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development process.

## Mocking and Test Doubles

- Use mocks, stubs, and spies to isolate code under test and replace external dependencies. This ensures tests are fast and reliable.
- Be cautious with over-mocking, as it can lead to tests that don't accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

## Test Maintenance

- Regularly review and refactor tests to ensure they remain effective and relevant.
- Remove or update tests that no longer reflect the current design or requirements of the application.

## Further Resources

- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/): Used for unit and integration testing across our frontend and backend applications. Jest offers a powerful testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/): An alternative to Jest that we use in some projects, especially where Vite is part of our toolchain. Vitest provides a fast testing environment, leveraging Vite's native ES modules support.
- [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/): Our choice for end-to-end testing across all web applications. Playwright allows us to write tests that cover a wide range of browsers and operating systems, ensuring our applications are robust and user-friendly.

Each tool has been selected to complement our development process, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in our testing practices. We encourage team members to familiarize themselves with the documentation of these tools to leverage their full potential in our projects.

By following these guidelines, we aim to foster a culture of quality and continuous improvement within our development process.
