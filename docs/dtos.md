# DTOs in a Shared Library Documentation

## Overview

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are crucial in the design and implementation of software applications, serving as a method for data encapsulation and transfer between different parts of an application, especially between the presentation layer and the service layer. Opting to place DTOs in a shared library offers numerous advantages, promoting reusability, consistency, and reduced duplication across the application. This document outlines the approach of using DTOs within a shared library, highlighting the benefits and potential drawbacks, with a focus on using TypeScript's `Pick<>` utility to create efficient and relevant DTOs.

## Benefits of DTOs in a Shared Library

- **Reusability Across Layers and Services:** Centralizing DTOs encourages their reuse across different parts of the application, ensuring consistency in the data structures being passed around.
- **Reduced Code Duplication:** By defining DTOs in a single location, we mitigate the risk of duplicating data structures, which is particularly beneficial in larger projects or those with a microservices architecture.
- **Facilitates Decoupling:** Having a shared library for DTOs helps in decoupling layers from one another, allowing for independent updates and changes without impacting other parts of the application.

## Considerations

While the shared library approach for DTOs has its advantages, it's important to be mindful of potential over-abstraction and the added complexity in managing dependencies. Ensure that DTOs are designed with specific use cases in mind, avoiding overly generic structures that could lead to inefficient data handling.

## Implementing DTOs with TypeScript's `Pick<>`

TypeScript offers powerful utilities for creating and manipulating types, such as `Pick<>`, which allows us to create DTOs based on existing interfaces while selectively including or excluding certain attributes.

### Example: UserDTO

Assuming we have a `User` interface in our domain layer, we can create a `UserDTO` that includes specific attributes of the `User` interface, excluding sensitive or unnecessary fields like `id` for external communication.

```typescript
// Example User interface
interface IUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

class createUserDTO implements Pick<IUser, "username" | "email" | "password"> {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

class updateUserDTO extends Partial<createUserDTO> {}
```

This method allows for the creation of lightweight, purpose-specific DTOs that can efficiently transfer relevant data between the application's layers, while ensuring that sensitive or irrelevant information (like database-generated ids) is not exposed unnecessarily.

## Conclusion

Adopting DTOs within a shared library and leveraging TypeScript's type manipulation utilities like `Pick<>` presents a balanced approach to handling data structures in an application. It promotes reusability, consistency, and maintainability while cautioning against potential drawbacks such as over-abstraction and increased complexity. Careful design and implementation of DTOs, considering the specific needs of your application, will maximize the benefits of this approach.
