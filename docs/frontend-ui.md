# Frontend UI Libraries

Frontend UI libraries are pivotal for defining the visual and interactive aspects of an application. They are composed of reusable UI components, which help in maintaining consistency across the application and improving development efficiency. This document will guide you through the creation and management of Frontend UI libraries with a focus on Angular Standalone Components.

## Angular UI Library with Standalone Components

Angular's introduction of Standalone Components in version 14 simplifies the creation and distribution of reusable components by eliminating the need for Angular Modules for declaration. This section demonstrates how to implement a UI library using Standalone Components.

### Standalone Component Implementation

#### Example: Button Component

```typescript
// src/app/ui-library/button/button.component.ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-button',
  template: `<button [type]="type" class="btn">{{ label }}</button>`,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  styleUrls: ['./button.component.css'],
})
export class ButtonComponent {
  @Input() label: string = 'Default Label';
  @Input() type: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset' = 'button';
}
```

This `ButtonComponent` is a straightforward, reusable Angular component that can be easily integrated into any part of your application. It utilizes the `standalone: true` property, marking it as a standalone component, which simplifies its reusability by not requiring an Angular Module for its declaration.

### Usage in Application

To use the standalone component in your application, you can directly import it into any component without needing to declare it in an Angular Module.

```typescript
// src/app/app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ButtonComponent } from './ui-library/button/button.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: ` <app-button label="Click Me" type="submit"></app-button> `,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ButtonComponent],
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Best Practices

- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language and coding conventions across all UI components to ensure the application has a cohesive look and feel.
- **Reusability:** Design components with flexibility in mind, allowing them to be easily adapted and reused in different parts of the application. Utilize inputs to customize component behavior and appearance.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed documentation for each component, including usage examples and a list of available inputs, to make it easier for other developers to implement and customize these components.

## Conclusion

Frontend UI libraries, particularly with Angular Standalone Components, offer a streamlined approach to developing consistent and maintainable applications. By fostering a collection of reusable UI components, developers can enhance development speed, ensure uniformity across the application, and simplify design system updates. The principles of reusability, consistency, and thorough documentation are key to effectively leveraging the power of UI libraries in your development workflow.
