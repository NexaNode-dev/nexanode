# Defining Domain Interfaces for NexaNode

To ensure consistency across the frontend and backend of the NexaNode project, it's crucial to define domain interfaces that represent the data structures used within our domain. This guide outlines the process for creating and sharing these interfaces.

## Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:** Maintain interfaces in a shared directory or package that can be imported by both frontend and backend projects.
- **Consistency:** Use the same naming conventions and structures across frontend and backend to minimize confusion.

## Creating Interfaces

1. **Location:** Store interfaces in a shared directory within the monorepo, e.g., `/libs/shared/domain/interfaces`.
2. **Naming:** Name your interfaces clearly and consistently, e.g., `IUser` for a user interface.
3. **Structure:** Define properties based on the domain model, ensuring they are accurately represented and typed.

```typescript
export interface IUser {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

## Using Interfaces

- **Frontend**: Import and use interfaces for typing API responses, state management, and component props.
- **Backend**: Use interfaces for typing service methods, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and entities.

## Sharing Interfaces

Consider creating a shared NPM package or using a workspace library in your monorepo to share interfaces between frontend and backend projects efficiently.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Changes to data structures only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
- **Development Efficiency**: Clear contracts between frontend and backend speed up development and reduce bugs.

By following these guidelines, the NexaNode project can ensure that domain data structures are consistent, maintainable, and clearly defined across all parts of the application.
